## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the Bertelsmann data for the Udacity Data Scientst Nanodegree Capstone Project. In this Project I will look at the followung points:

1. How is the data structured and what are the different stastistics of the datas content
2. Whats the best Customer segmentation
3. Building a model to find future customers for a mail-order company
4. Taking part in a kaggle competition
